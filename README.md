# Energy-and-Environmental-Data-Exploration
## Overview

This repository contains data and visualizations related to global energy consumption, sources, and associated factors. The dataset is obtained from Our World in Data and includes information on energy sources, energy use by countries, population, and GDP. The goal is to analyze relationships between these fields, draw conclusions about energy use situations, and make predictions.

- **Analysis:** Shows a considerable increase in renewable energy consumption, particularly in solar energy.

#### 2. Composition of Energy Consumption Over Time

- **Questions:**
  - How has energy consumption changed over time?
  - How does the usage of renewable and fossil fuels vary across all countries?
- **Analysis:** Highlights the increase in total energy consumption, with coal and oil contributing significantly.

#### 3. Carbon Intensity Consumption

- **Questions:**
  - Is there a relationship between population and carbon intensity?
  - Is there a relationship between GDP and energy consumption?
  - Which countries have the highest and lowest consumption from low carbon sources?
- **Analysis:** No conclusive evidence for population and carbon intensity; positive trends between GDP and low carbon consumption.

#### 4. Share of Renewable and Fossil Energy Sources

- **Question:** How has the share of renewable and fossil energies changed throughout the years?
- **Analysis:** Demonstrates a steady increase in renewable energy sources.

#### 5. Renewables Generation Over the Years

- **Question:** How has the generation of renewable energy changed over the years?
- **Analysis:** Indicates progress in renewable energy consumption, with a focus on hydro, nuclear, wind, and solar.

#### 6. Forecast for Renewable Energy Sources

- **Question:** What is the forecast for renewable energy sources worldwide?
- **Analysis:** Forecasts growth for all types of renewable energy except nuclear, which might decline.

#### 7. Share of Energy for Renewable Energy Sources

- **Question:** How does the share of renewable energy sources compare for countries with the highest consumption?
- **Analysis:** Reveals that even environmentally conscious nations have a relatively low percentage of renewable energy consumption.

#### 8. Story

- A series of interactive dashboards guiding users through an educational journey on global energy consumption.

### Part B - POWER BI

#### Data Model

- Diagram illustrating the relationships between different datasets.

#### Dashboard 1: Energy Consumption, Production, and Greenhouse Gas Emission by Canada (1992-2021)

- **Questions:**
  - What energy source is used the most in Canada?
  - What proportion do these energy sources account for?
- **Analysis:** Highlights Canada's energy mix, fossil fuel and renewable consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.

#### Dashboard 2: Electricity by Source, Electricity Demand, and Generation in Canada

- **Questions:**
  - How are the changes in electricity by source over the last 30 years?
  - How has electricity demand changed over the years?
- **Analysis:** Focuses on electricity sources, demand, and generation trends in Canada.

#### Canada: Energy Consumption and Household Income

- **Question:** What is the relation between household income and energy consumption in the country?
- **Analysis:** Explores the relationship between energy consumption and income levels across Canadian provinces.

#### Canada: Energy Consumption by Dwelling Type

- **Question:** What is the contribution of each type of dwelling to the total energy consumption of the country?
- **Analysis:** Examines the energy consumption patterns based on different dwelling types in Canada.

#### GDP and CO2 Emissions

- **Question:** Are the wealthiest countries the ones that produce more CO2 emissions?
- **Analysis:** Explores the relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions globally, with some exceptions.

#### CO2 Emissions Breakdown â€“ Drill Through Detail by Country

- **Questions:**
  - What are the countries producing the most CO2?
  - How many tons of CO2 are produced per economic activity?
- **Analysis:** Breaks down CO2 emissions by country, economic activity, and provides insights into population changes.

## Conclusion

The visualizations reveal insights into global energy consumption, renewable energy trends, and their relationships with various factors. Key findings include increased renewable energy consumption, positive trends in GDP and low carbon consumption, and the potential for sustainable energy practices. The visualizations also highlight the importance of data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI in gaining insights into renewable energy consumption and generation.

## Future Work

Future work could explore the impact of policy decisions, changes in renewable energy technologies, and conduct comparative analyses of different regions. Integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms could improve the accuracy of energy demand forecasts. Additionally, the insights obtained can inform policy and investment decisions in renewable energy, targeting countries with high populations and lower per capita consumption for infrastructure investments.

## Final Note

While the visualizations effectively address specific inquiries, the extensive nature of the topic requires additional data, such as country-level energy consumption data disaggregated by demographic groups, economic activities, and other relevant factors, for a comprehensive analysis.
